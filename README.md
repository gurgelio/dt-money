# Pomodoro

This app was built as an exercise for a course @ [Rocketseat](http://rocketseat.com.br)

## What I've Learned

- Use of headless components with Radix UI
- State management with Tanstack Query
- Integrating custom components with React Hook Form

## Running Locally

This project only depends on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Simply run:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev:server & npm run dev
```
